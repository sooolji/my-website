        <h2>first year of computer science (≧ω≦)</h2>
        <p>hey there! as a first-year computer science student at universidad de oriente in santiago de cuba, cuba, i've been diving into some seriously cool topics!</p>
        
        <h2>first semester:</h2>
        <p>my first week was a total vibe check as i got introduced to the world of computer science! here's what i got into:</p>
        <h3>programming i</h3>
        <p>this class was like opening a treasure chest of coding knowledge! i learned about algorithms and how computers think. we kicked things off with c++, where i got to play around with control structures and arrays. the best part? mastering pointers and dynamic variables felt like unlocking a new level in a game!</p>
        <h3>algebra i (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻</h3>
        <p>who knew algebra could be so lit?  we explored complex numbers and got into some advanced polynomial topics. tackling linear and matrix equations was like solving a mystery, and vector spaces? total mind-blown moment!</p>
        <h3>mathematical analysis i </h3>
        <p>this course was all about diving deep into the world of functions! we tackled numerical sequences and learned about limits and continuity. derivatives and integrals? math secret has been reveal to me!</p>
        <h3>logic (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧</h3>
        <p>talk about a brain workout! in this class, we explored sets, relations, and functions. propositional logic was like solving puzzles, and learning about logic circuits made me feel like a tech wizard!</p>
        <p>oh, and i joined a chess club as part of my physical education course! it was super fun honing my strategic thinking skills. plus, i got to explore the history of computing in "historia de la computación" and dive into some philosophical topics in philosophy class.</p>
        <p>one of the highlights? writing "an interview with chatgpt"! interviewing an ai was such a cool experience! (｡✪ω✪｡)</p>
        
        <h2>round 2 (✧▽✧) </h2>
        <p>the second semester was all about leveling up my skills! here's what i got into:</p>
        <h3>physical education</h3>
        <p>i kept my energy up by staying active in the chess club! strategic thinking? check! it was a blast challenging my friends and improving my game.</p>
        <h3>professional practice and research i </h3>
        <p>this course was super hands-on! i got to design a graphical user interface (gui) for a c++ project, which was like bringing my coding ideas to life! (╯°▽°)╯ </p>
        <h3>history of cuba</h3>
        <p>this class was all about my roots! learning about the rich history of cuba, time traveling babies :> </p>
        <h3>elective course</h3>
        <p>in this elective, we explored how the internet works!  we compared office suites like libreoffice and microsoft office, and it was eye-opening to see the differences and things like that, also they introduce us to linux.</p>
        <h3>programming ii (｡♥‿♥｡)</h3>
        <p>this was where the magic happened! we dove into classes and objects, operator overloading, and even inheritance and polymorphism. it felt like i was learning to create my own c++ compiler (hint i'm)! </p>
        <h3>algebra ii</h3>
        <p>more algebra? yes, please (*sarcasm in here). we tackled analytical geometry and quadratic forms, and exploring euclidean spaces</p>
        <h3>mathematical analysis ii baby (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧</h3>
        <p>this course was all about functions of several variables! we learned about series and limits, and it was like unlocking a new level of mathematical understanding and it's applications </p
